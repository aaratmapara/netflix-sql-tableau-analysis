-- Result:
-- TV Show : avg_years_to_catalog = 2.31, titles_count = 2654
-- Movie   : avg_years_to_catalog = 5.73, titles_count = 6129

-- Analysis:
-- TV shows reach Netflix much faster than movies, with an average lag of just ~2.3 years.
-- Movies take longer (~5.7 years), suggesting Netflix often licenses older films for its catalog.
-- This reflects Netflixâ€™s strategic focus on offering fresh TV content while maintaining a back-catalog of movies.
